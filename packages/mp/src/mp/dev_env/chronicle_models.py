"""Typed models for the Chronicle API JSON responses consumed by the dev-env client.

Responses are parsed once into these models at the boundary and accessed via attributes,
rather than navigated as raw dicts. Only the fields the client actually consumes are
modelled; unknown fields are ignored (``extra="ignore"``).
